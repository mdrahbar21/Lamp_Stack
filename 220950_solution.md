# Details

Rename this file in the format `yourRollNumber_solution.md` (example, `220000_solution.md`) and create a pull request in the parent repository on github.


## Your zeroth approach below

Reasoning - When I try to compile the file it gave me error. So i commented out that part. And then i type `man` on my terminal. And i got hint for first.txt

```
What manual page do you want?
For example, try 'man man'.
```

---

## Your first approach below (first.txt)

Reasoning - First doing `cat first.txt` and after analysing text (there is *s* two times in first.txt, so i guess *a* maybe replaced be *s*) I got to know alphabets are rotated by 18.

```
noicee you did crack a rotation encryption on your own. The following is a clue for the next puzzle: CLASS of that INPUT
```

---

## Your second approach below (strings.txt)

Reasoning - After Unzipping a zip file in the directory. When we use find we see that `strings.txt` is in `/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/1/5/0/3/`. After finding the location of strings `eleven.txt` is the password.

```
eleven.txt
```

---

## Your third approach below (fourth.zip)

Reasoning - After unlocking that zip. We will use `grep -r DevOps .` to find string that has DevOps{} in it.

```
DevOps{y0ur3_4w350m3_4nd_0ne_5t3p_c1053r}
```
